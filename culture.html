                    <h5 class="text-success mt-4">Elves</h5>
                    <p>Iceland has a rich history of folklore and legends. Being a small, isolated island close to the Arctic Circle the environment was the perfect breeding ground for tales of strange creatures and supernatural beings.</p>
                    <p>Stories of elves and the Hidden Folk have been around in Iceland for centuries. The Hidden Folk live in rocks and hills and Icelanders are very respectful of their homes, often going as far as curving roads around rocks that are believed to be Elf houses.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-6 border">
                    <h5 class="text-success mt-4">Trolls</h5>
                    <p>According to Icelandic folklore, trolls lived in the mountains and only came down from them to forage for food. Trolls can only survive in the darkness of night (guess they just stayed home for the endless daylight in summer then) and if they were caught in the sunlight they would immediately turn to stone. The best-known, and perhaps most feared, troll in Icelandic folklore is without a doubt Grýla. She was the mother of all thirteen Yule Lads and she is known to eat naughty children, which is why all Icelandic children are exceptionally well-behaved in December. </p>
                    <img src="Pictures/troll-sm.jpg" alt="Iceland Troll" class="rounded"/>
                </div>
                <div class="border mt-1">
                    <h5 class="text-success mt-4">This lore spreads all year round, even to Christmas!</h5>
                    <p>What is Santa Claus called in Iceland? The short answer is: There is no Santa Clause, but there are 13 Yule Lads! They're called "Jolasveinar" in Icelandic and named after their characteristics. The Icelandic Yule Lads live in the highlands with their troll parents, Gryla and Leppaludi. They have a big, black cat called Jolakotturinn (the Christmas Cat). Their mother, Gryla, is a giant, frightening troll that eats naughty children and cooks them in a large pot. Their father, Leppaludi, is a lazy troll who's not too keen on eating children. He's a rather useless chap and does whatever Gryla tells him to do, so he often picks up the naughty kids for her. The Icelandic Christmas Cat also loves the taste of humans, whether they've been naughty or nice. However, the only people the cat gets to eat are those who didn't get a new item of clothing before Christmas. So if you don't want a giant troll cat to eat your loved ones in Iceland, you'd better give them at least one pair of socks!</p>
                    <p> The rich culture of Iceland is one to explore. With unique food to famous artist's there is much to delve into. </p>
                    <p>Aside from their Viking roots, Icelanders have a strong culture of food, literature and the arts.</p>
